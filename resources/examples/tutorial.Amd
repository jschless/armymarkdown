- **PURPOSE**: This memorandum serves as a comprehensive tutorial for using Army Markdown to create professional military correspondence that is always perfectly formatted in accordance with AR 25-50.

- **BACKGROUND**: Traditional word processors often result in formatting inconsistencies and errors in military memos. Army Markdown eliminates these issues by using simple text formatting that automatically generates properly formatted memos.

- **BASIC FORMATTING RULES**:
    - Begin each main point with a dash (-) followed by a space
    - Sub-points are created by indenting 4 spaces (or one tab) before the dash
    - Further sub-points can be created with additional 4-space indentations
    - The system automatically handles numbering (1., 2., 3.) and lettering ((a), (b), (c))

- **TEXT FORMATTING OPTIONS**:
    - **Bold text**: Surround text with double asterisks: **this will be bold**
    - *Italic text*: Surround text with single asterisks: *this will be italicized*
    - ***Underlined text***: Surround text with triple asterisks: ***this will be underlined***
    - You can combine formatting: ***Bold and underlined*** or **bold with *italics* inside**

- **PARAGRAPH CONTINUATION**: You can add additional paragraphs to the same bullet point by leaving a blank line and continuing without a new dash, just like this paragraph demonstrates.

- **DETAILED EXAMPLE OF NESTED STRUCTURE**:
    - This is a first-level sub-point (will show as "a.")
    - This is another first-level sub-point (will show as "b.")
        - This is a second-level sub-point (will show as "(1)")
        - Another second-level sub-point (will show as "(2)")
            - This is a third-level sub-point (will show as "(a)")
            - Final third-level sub-point (will show as "(b)")
    - Back to first-level (will show as "c.")

- **COMMON ARMY MEMO ELEMENTS**:
    - **Recommendations**: Use clear, actionable language
    - **Timelines**: Include specific dates and suspense requirements
    - **References**: Cite applicable regulations, policies, or directives
    - **Coordination**: Identify who needs to be informed or take action

- **BEST PRACTICES**:
    - Keep sentences concise and direct
    - Use active voice whenever possible
    - Avoid unnecessary jargon or acronyms without definition
    - Ensure each point flows logically to the next
    - Always include point of contact information
