# Project Overview

The Army relies on memorandums to operate. The guidelines for these memorandums are fairly simple, but it can be tedious to implement them in Microsoft Word.
The goal of this project is to develop a markdown language for Army memos. A compiler will take this markdown and proofread it according to AR 25-50 Managing Correspondence, and output a word document that meets specifications.
