\begin{enumerate}
\item This memo is a demonstration of Army markdown, a new way to quickly create memos that will ALWAYS be perfectly formatted IAW with AR 25-50.
\item Don't worry about numbering or lettering. Simply begin each line with a "-", we'll take care of everything else.
\item To create an indented section, simply indent the next line 4 spaces (or hit tab in the browser).
\begin{enumerate}
\item This indented section will begin with (a).
\begin{enumerate}
\item We can indent even further.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We can try to indent further, but it will only change from numbers to letters.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Look} at \textit{this} special \underline{formatting}.

You can also add a second paragraph to the same bullet by simply skipping a line \textit{without} a new hyphen.
\item Press the "Create Memo PDF" button when you're done and wait for your memo to load! Don't close the tab!
\item The point of contact for this memorandum is the undersigned available at james.f.ryan@army.mil or (123) 867-5309.
